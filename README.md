# BMI Calculator

## Introduction

This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator app built using Swift. It is designed to help users calculate their BMI based on their weight and height and provides health advice based on the calculated BMI. The project showcases the use of Optionals, the MVC design pattern, and introduces the concept of Classes in Swift.

## Features

- Multi-screen app with animated navigation.
- BMI calculation based on user input.
- Health advice based on BMI results.
- Demonstrates the use of optional binding, optional chaining, and the nil coalescing operator.
- Illustrates the difference between classes and structs.
- Utilizes pass by value vs. pass by reference.
- String formatting and use of color literals.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Multi-Screen Apps:** Learn how to create multi-screen applications with animated navigation.
- **Optionals:** Understand optional binding, optional chaining, and the nil coalescing operator.
- **Classes and Structs:** Discover how to create classes and understand the differences between classes and structs.
- **Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference:** Grasp the concept of passing by value and passing by reference.
- **String Formatting:** Learn how to format strings effectively.
